        <h3>Here is a time I got blocked on a simple problem:</h3>

        <p>
            I buddy-coded the “Where Are You?” Kata which involves finding “Scooby” behind a number of hidden doors. We had worked on each step of the code together and had shared code as copy paste in Slack. At the end of the challenge, my buddy’s code was working but mine would only return errors. I ended up writing the code from scratch again and it turned out I had accidentally copied a “}” over without realising it. I think I had spent too much time ignoring the suggested breaks from my Pomodoro timer and had grown fatigued. 
        </P>
        
        <P>
            I learnt that you’re better off writing code from one source to another for two reasons: a) you help to commit the code to memory while you copy it and b) you’re less likely to carry mistakes over from your source.
        </p>

        <h3>Did I solve a problem in an elegant way?</h3>
        
        <p>
            I don’t think I could possibly claim to have solved a problem in an elegant way yet...I’m currently just content solving a problem at all. I hope in a few years time I’ll feel more like a virtuoso. For now I’ll do my best to write code that is legible and makes sense and will strive for excellence once I have a bit more experience under my belt. 
        </p>

        <h3>Musing on various problem solving techniques:</h3>

        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>

        <p>
            I feel moderately confident but I found it took practice and rewriting my code to actually make it useful. I guess I refactored my own Pseudocode! When I was really stuck on a problem a couple of times I wrote Pseudo from the test solutions then wrote my own code back from that which was really helpful.
        </p>

        <h3>Trying something</h3>

        <p>Trying something before Pseudo felt like a bit of a waste of time and I think would get me into trouble on larger projects. Trying something afterwards is great though!</p>

        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>

        <p>This is my favourite method and my first step in solving a problem! I made sure to explain my problem to my inanimate object before deciding I needed to ask others for help. Next step was straight to my peers.</p>

        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>

        <p>This is a skill I’m slowly developing. I currently find error messages can either give me the immediate answer to my problem or leave me feeling more baffled than before. </p>

        <h3>Console.logging</h3>

        <p>Awesome technique and a great way to work through a multi-step problem when the tests aren’t throwing you enough information.</p>

        <h3>Googling</h3>

        <p>Google and Stack Overflow can answer most of your problems if you know how to pose your question. I find google most helpful for understanding a problem once I’ve broken it down. It’s easier to find answers to small pieces of a problem than a solution that will solve your whole challenge. For this reason I like using google to gain an understanding of the techniques I need to use to solve a problem. I find it more helpful to then ask for help putting it all together from my peers or a facilitator.</p>

        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>

        <p>Coming from a background of Fixed Mindset this one was hard to get used to at first but there is something refreshing in coming to accept that I’m woefully incompetent at coding at the moment and that’s OK. The quickest, easiest way to improve is to ask for help from those who have more experience than me. I grew to really enjoy getting help from my peers. It gave me a feeling of camaraderie and helped to ease my stress by making the whole cohorts struggle relatable. 
        </p>

        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>

        <p>I tried to solve solutions with solo and peer problem solving solutions first but ultimately had no trouble asking my coach for help. I wanted to understand the problem well enough and feel like I’d made my best effort at understanding things before trying my coach.
        </p>

        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>

        <p>I found reflection and meditation helpful to manage my stress and maintain focus. Noticing that I was unproductive as a consequence of trying to be too productive was an interesting realisation. Reflecting on this and forcing myself to listen to my Pomodoro made a huge difference in my level of focus. </p>
