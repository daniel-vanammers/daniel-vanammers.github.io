    <h1>My Values, Strengths and Weaknesses</h1>
    <h3>25 April 2019</h3>
  </div>
 
    <h3>Family Culture as an Influence</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> 
        My family culture has probably had the greatest influence on my values and identity. My Dad is an Anaesthetist and as such is analytical, logical, argues well, values education and application above most else. My Mum is a professional Artist and writer and always encouraged a connection with our community, our inner selves and our creative development. I consistently score as The Advocate on the Myers-Briggs test which makes sense considering my varied family environment. I look forward to finding my place within the IT industry where I can not only flex my competencies but develop my weak spots.
        </p>

    <h3>Core Personal Values</h3>
        <p>
        Authenticity - I expect people to be open and honest about where they stand and what they believe in - I loathe duplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Kindness - Sometimes it is more important to be kind than right.
        </p>
        <p>
        Integrity and Sincerity - I take my word very seriously and demand the same of others. My reputation is my word.
        </p>    
        <p> 
        Dependability - It is important for me to be consistent with people. I believe people should be able to rely on me without worry.
        </p>
        <p>
        Warmth - Genuine warmth is something I pride myself on giving to people. I am empathetic and relate to people quickly and with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
        I expect reciprocation of these values from my friends and loved ones. As such I can be a harsh judge of people and keep my life quite private until I feel comfortable that someone has met these expectations. I am pleasant to people who don't, but take care not to unnecessarily expend my energy.
        </p>

    <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>

        <h4>Competencies</h4>

         <p>I am empathetic and relate quickly and well to a diverse array of people.</p>
         <p>I am insightful and see through people's dishonesty quickly, and conversely can determine genuine natures easily.</p>
         <p>I speak well in human terms and put people at ease, gaining trust.</p>
         <p>I am altruistic and hold strong beliefs.</p>
         <p>I work well in teams, usually as a leader but simultaneously as an equal, demanding performance through respect.</p>
         <p>I learn quickly and make sense of complex ideas competently.</p>
         <p>I enjoy learning and derive satisfaction from difficult tasks.</p>

        <h4>Weaknesses (or areas to improve on)</h4>

         <p> I am sensitive, especially to harsh criticism.</p>
         <p> I am a perfectionist, which can manifest itself as inefficient.</p>
         <p>I am extremely private with my personal life, only letting people in once I am very comfortable around them.</p>
         <p>I can be dispassionate with my problem solving, erring on the side of rational/overly logical. This can manifest as a lack of sensitivity.</p>
         <p>I can struggle with time management and focus over long periods.</p>
