    <h1>My Values, Strengths and Weaknesses</h1>
    <h3>25 April 2019</h3>
  </div>
 
    <h3>Family Culture as an Influence</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">

        <p> 
        My family culture has probably had the greatest influence on my values and identity. My Dad is an Anaesthetist and as such is analytical, logical, argues well, values education and application above most else. My Mum is a professional Artist and writer and always encouraged a connection with our community, our inner selves and our creative development. I consistently score as The Advocate on the Myers-Briggs test which makes sense considering my varied family environment. I look forward to finding my place within the IT industry where I can not only flex my competencies but develop my weak spots.
        </p>

    <h3>Core Personal Values</h3>
        <p>
        Authenticity - I expect people to be open and honest about where they stand and what they believe in - I loathe duplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Kindness - Sometimes it is more important to be kind than right.
        </p>
        <p>
        Integrity and Sincerity - I take my word very seriously and demand the same of others. My reputation is my word.
        </p>    
        <p> 
        Dependability - It is important for me to be consistent with people. I believe people should be able to rely on me without worry.
        </p>
        <p>
        Warmth - Genuine warmth is something I pride myself on giving to people. I am empathetic and relate to people quickly and with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
        I expect reciprocation of these values from my friends and loved ones. As such I can be a harsh judge of people and keep my life quite private until I feel comfortable that someone has met these expectations. I am pleasant to people who don't, but take care not to unnecessarily expend my energy.
