                <h2>Identities and Values</h2>
                <h3>25 April 2019</h3>
        </div>
                <h3>Core Personal Values</h3>

                <p>Authenticity - I expect people to be open and honest about where they stand and what they believe in - I loathe duplicitous characters.</p>
                <p>Kindness - Sometimes it is more important to be kind than right. It is easy to offer small kindnesses to people</p>
                <p>Integrity and Sincerity - I take my word very seriously and demand the same of others. My reputation is my word.</p>
                <p>Dependability - It is important for me to be consistent with people. I believe people should be able to rely on me without worry.</p>
                <p>Warmth - Genuine warmth is something I pride myself on giving to people. I am highly empathetic and relate to people quickly and with ease.</p>
                <p>I expect reciprocation of these values from my friends and loved ones. As such I can be a harsh judge of people and keep my life quite private until I feel comfortable that someone has met my high expectation. I am pleasant to people who don't but take care not to waste my energy.</p>

                <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>

                <h4>The Good</h4>

                <p>I am empathetic and relate quickly and well to a diverse array of people.</p>
                <p>I am insightful and see through people's dishonesty quickly, and conversely can determine genuine natures easily.</p>
                <p>I speak well in human terms and put people at ease, gaining trust.</p>
                <p>I am altruistic and hold strong beliefs.</p>
                <p>I work well in teams, usually as a leader but simultaneously as an equal, demanding performance through respect.</p>
                <p>I learn quickly and make sense of complex ideas competently.</p>
                <p>I enjoy learning and derive satisfaction from difficult tasks.</p>
                
                <h4>The Not so Good</h4>

                <p>I am sensitive, especially to harsh criticism.</p>
                <p>I am a perfectionist, which can manifest itself as inefficient.</p>
                <p>I am extremely private with my personal life, only letting people in once I am very comfortable around them.</p>
                <p>I can be dispassionate with my problem solving, erring on the side of rational/overly logical.</p>
                <p>I can struggle with time management and focus over long periods. </p>

                <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>

                <p>I was recently involved in a scenario where a single male was acting in a lewd manner at the beach in close proximity to a children’s playground. I considered taking action for a moment before calling the police, who apprehended the man and took him to the police station. I believe firmly in altruism and the greater good and authenticity and integrity in one’s beliefs. Reflection on my own values removed any doubt about what I had to do.</p>
                <p>The ethical decision I had to make was whether or not I was willing to inconvenience myself in order to protect other people at the beach. I knew that by calling the police both my partner and I would have to give statements, consuming considerable free time (of which we have little).</p>
                <p>The consequences are (predictably) that we will both need to appear in court to give statements before a jury (I loathe public speaking). We have dedicated upwards of 10 hours of our own time providing statements to the police. It is almost certainly going to further inconvenience our busy lives but I have no regrets.</p>

                <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>

                <p>My family culture has probably had the greatest influence on my values and identity. My Dad is an Anaesthetist and as such is analytical, logical, argues well, values education and application above most else. My Mum is a professional Artist and writer and always encouraged a connection with our community, our inner selves and our creative development. I consistently score as The Advocate on the Myers-Briggs test which makes sense considering my varied family environment. I look forward to finding my place within the IT industry where I can not only flex my competencies but develop my weak spots.</p>

                <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
                </h4>

                <p>My core strengths play well into team environments. I naturally lead and enjoy being in charge but I take others suggestions on board well and tend to participate from the perspective of an equal. This means I encourage results through hard work and respect which I have found to be an effective long term solution.</p>
                <p>I am inquisitive with my learning and development and get joy from applying new skills.</p>
                <p>In a professional environment, despite social capabilities, I tire quickly and require space and quiet to be productive. I can have trouble focussing in busy environments with lots of distractions. I require feedback but respond poorly to criticism that is not delivered in a diplomatic way as I am very sensitive.</p>

                <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>

                <p>The fact I enjoy learning and don’t shy away from difficult tasks will aid me greatly in learning something complex like programming. My ability to work well alongside others will help with the team-like nature of an IT environment.</p>

                <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>

                <p>At a restaurant I was managing one of the Directors would consistently embark on inappropriate relations with female staff I had hired. This happened on four separate occasions. Building a team in hospitality relies heavily on nurturing a delicate team culture where everyone respects and trusts each other. The tension these behaviours incorporated into the team environment was detrimental to our overall productivity and something needed to be done.</p>
                <p>I carefully took each member of the team aside and explained the effect they were having on the overall workspace. I explained that they were letting their team members down and that they were making my work life needlessly difficult. I explained to the Director that I wouldn’t stay in an environment where a superior was knowingly making my life more difficult. I explained to the employee that I wouldn’t allow for rifts to be created within my team and that changes needed to happen to ensure the continuation of their employment. </p>
                <p>The outcome was moderately effective. The employee left of her own volition and the Director stopped being inappropriate. In future I would have addressed the issue much sooner, and would have potentially involved the other Directors as I didn’t feel it was my job to police a superior.</p>
