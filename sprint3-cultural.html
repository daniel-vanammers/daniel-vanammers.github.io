            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <h3>EQ: What is it and how does it compare to IQ?</h3>
          </div>

          <p>Emotional Intelligence is the “capacity to be aware of, control, and express one’s emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically”.</p>
          <p>In practice, this means that we have an awareness of the fact that our emotions play a large role in how we interact with other people, ourselves and our overall work environment.</p>
          <p>According to The EQ Edge by Steven J. Stein, Ph.D. and Howard E. Book, M.D:</p>
          <p>“Emotional Quotient is the set of skills that enable us to make our way in a complex world — the personal, social and survival aspects of overall intelligence, the elusive common sense and sensitivity that are essential to effective daily functioning. It has to do with the ability to read the political and social environment, and landscape them; to intuitively grasp what others want and need, what strengths and weaknesses are; to remain unruffled by stress; and to be engaging. The kind of person others want to be around and will follow.”</p>
          <p>IQ is a static measure of one’s ability to solve a problem or apply knowledge in a predefined way. It measures working memory, visual processing and reasoning. EQ measures the intangible skill set that allows us to apply our abilities in a real world environment. Where IQ is a measure of innate abilities, EQ is a collection of skills that can be improved and honed through practice and application. EQ is like street smarts whereas IQ is like book smarts.</p>
          <p>EQ is so important because it determines the way that we interact with the world as individuals. It is all well and good being technically competent in a given field, but no man is an Island. If one can’t cooperate, relate, interact and work alongside other humans, then this IQ measure becomes somewhat redundant. </p>
          <p>Additionally, nurturing a higher EQ creates a feedback loop that increases one’s abilities for self-improvement. Being aware of your emotions and being able to control them in a situation will increase your likelihood of success. Empathy of others emotions, for example, will improve your chances of success in team projects, and also in leadership roles. </p>
