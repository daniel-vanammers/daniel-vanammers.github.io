            <h2>Reflection on Foundations Core Skills</h2>
            <h3>19 May 2019</h3>
          </div>

        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
            I came into foundations with a really Fixed Mindset as I derive a lot of my ego from my sense of ability and intelligence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Coming into an environment where it was not only accepted but encouraged to rethink my abilities and celebrate the fact that I’m coming in fresh and have nowhere to go but up is really refreshing. I feel like I’m quite happy being incompetent as a coder for now - it is the attitude that I can, and want to improve that really matters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought I would really struggle to work alongside other students in the pair programming exercises but was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually really enjoyed it and found bouncing ideas off my peers incredibly productive.
        </p>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
            I found the meditation significantly more beneficial than I had expected. I wasn’t exactly a skeptic before, as I know a few people who have seen the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, but I didn’t realise it would be such an easy and immediate solution to concentration and stress issues. I found myself using mindfulness often as a way to control my stress and reset my focus.
        </p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
            I found consistent stretches of focus a real challenge, especially towards the beginning. I had to use mindfulness over my negative thoughts and techniques like Pomodoro timers to maintain concentration. I slowly learnt to break my tasks up into smaller chunks and take breaks often as I was overall more productive this way. Ignoring the little voice telling me to just do a little more, ignore my Pomodoro break, took a good bit of effort to overcome.  
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>

        <p>
            Because software development is such a team-based industry. Employers are looking for employees that boost their company culture - competence in programming is often second to your ability to get along with others and engender a high productivity team.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

        <p>
            I would not have been anywhere near as engaged in the material without the core learning aspect of Foundations. I would have found the scale and complexity of the tasks set for us unmanageable without tools like time management techniques and meditation. Having the help and support of my peers was instrumental to my completion of the technical tasks. Moving forward I am aware of how important it is to be a good human being to work with, and that technical competence is only one piece of the puzzle.
