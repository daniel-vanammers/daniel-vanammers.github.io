        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <h4>How might Neuroplasticity benefit people?</h4>

        <p>It has been shown that students gain both a performance and morale boost to their learning when they are informed of the fact that they have agency over their ability to learn. Having this understanding encourages people to take learning into their own hands and reinforces the fact that application has direct consequences.</p>

        <h4>How might I employ the principles of Neuroplasticity for my own benefit?</h4>

        <p>I will endeavour to make the material I am learning relevant to my own life experiences. This will help to reinforce pathways that already exist, while creating new ones alongside them. I will exercise Mindfulness as focus has a significant effect of the brain’s ability to create new pathways.</p>

        <h4>How might we increase our Neuroplasticity?</h4>

        <p>Practice and repetition are extremely helpful. Visualisation is almost as effective as physical practice. Set goals -> recognise triggers -> make conscious decisions -> seek pleasure that rewards healthy pursuits -> new pathway is strengthened -> new habit is formed.</p>

       <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

       <h4>Why is it relevant?</h4>
        <p>From Harvard Business Review: “Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset.” It is relevant because we at EDA are embarking on massive brain growth in a short period of time. We need to employ Growth Mindset strategies to make this personal change possible.</p>

        <h4>Did anything in this exploration surprise me?</h4>
        <p>I have a Bachelors in Psychology so not a whole lot here I hadn’t covered. It’s been some years though and it’s nice to have it brought into the forefront of my thinking again.</p>

        <h4>How I will integrate Growth Mindset into my learning journey:</h4>

        <p>I will make a particular effort to bring the group aspect of Growth Mindset (GM) into play on my learning journey at EDA. As evidence shows that GM doesn’t work as effectively in a vacuum, I will aim to collaborate, ask and answer questions of my peers, and encourage and reward risk taking. I will try to be mindful of fixed-mindset triggers on my journey, particularly aiming to improve on reception of critics and feedback and admitting errors.</p>
