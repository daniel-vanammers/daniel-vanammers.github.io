        <p>I want to ultimately be a Project Manager or Product Lead within the IT industry. I love managing and growing people within a team. My preferences: I would love to operate within an area of IT that deals with VR, AR, machine learning or even game development.</p>
        <p>I would like to improve my time-management and productivity skills more than anything. The past few years of my work life has seen little improvement of these skills so I would like to make up the slight lag I may have acquired when compared to my peers.</p>
        <p>I would also like develop my ability to take other people’s input onboard more effectively. I am painfully stubborn and don’t always respond to criticism or suggestion very well.</p>
        <p>My strengths include anything that requires innate abilities with human interaction. I’m a competent, agile human being when it comes to interpersonal dynamics. I read people well and relate to people on an individual level with ease. I am patient with people and an effective teacher.</p>
        <p>I have well developed visual-spatial skills, problem solving and ‘bigger picture’ abilities. As a consequence I can find the minutiae of projects frustrating, preferring to guide a broader process rather than partake in the individual parts. This is something I’m really hoping Software Development will help me to develop into a strength. </p>
        <p>As far as limitations go - I can procrastinate better than most if I’m not enthused by a task. I don’t work well without a clear purpose and I’m susceptible to distractions.</p>
        <p>When having an argument or difference of opinion I can be frustratingly direct and logical. I struggle to bring my emotions into arguments which doesn’t help mitigate disagreements. I would like to work on being less dispassionate. </p>
        <p>The main thing I really want to stick to is being procedural in how I tackle tasks. I want to be methodical from the outset. I want to define my goals before I try to tackle them and break them into manageable chunks to avoid becoming overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>I plan to use pomodoro for high-focus tasks like programming and want to develop this into a second-nature habit.</p>
        <p>In order to stay engaged with tasks I want to work with a team of mixed strengths. This way, we can all hopefully tackle the task that is best suited to each individuals strengths.</p>
        <p>I will look for answers to problems by myself first. I will use the resources available to me before reaching out to my peers. If I still can’t find resolution from these two resources I will reach out to my facilitator. I will try to avoid being too proud, wasting time when help is only a question away.</p>
        <p>I would like the facilitation team to make sure that I am sticking to my promises of focus and application. If I feel like I am meeting expectations I am more likely to work harder to achieve my goals.</p>
        <p>I won’t do work or check messages when I am with my family. I feel strongly about having as few interruptions as possible when I’m having quality time. I plan to be selectively productive so that my work doesn’t bleed into my private life.</p>
        <p>I have kindergarten drop offs for my 3-year old 3 days a week. I will aim to be on site as soon as I have dropped him off.</p>
        <p>I am lucky that my partner’s work can be flexible during my time at EDA. As such, I shouldn’t have too much difficulty giving it everything I have.</p>
