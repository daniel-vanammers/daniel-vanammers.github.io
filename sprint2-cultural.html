          <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
          <h3>19 May 2019</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
          My long time goal is to reach a position of direction within the IT industry. I’d like to work on numerous projects that have a tangible purpose. I would love to work with open source technologies and be maximally engaged with the industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think my biggest limitations for Bootcamp will be my ability to stay on task for long enough, and consistently enough to take all of the technical learning on board. I am not a confident public speaker, and I think having to speak in front of my peers will take some getting used to. As this is a key gap in my skillset I am looking forward to overcoming this limitation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am capable when it comes to interacting with a multitude of people. I look forward to getting to know everyone, building a strong team and helping others grow alongside me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worry the most about keeping my momentum up for nine weeks straight while actually learning all of the material expected of me. I worry about getting behind and running out of time to keep up with everyone else. I do not look forward to the presentations at the end of Bootcamp and hope I will have developed my confidence in public speaking significantly by then.  
        </p>

        <p>
          I would really like to improve my ability to take and receive feedback - both positive and negative. I would like to improve on my openness in a group setting. I want to be available to people and be easier for others to understand - be less closed off. 
        </p>

        <p>
          As far as what I expect from the Bootcamp team: I would just like them to be available when I have questions, and to be forthcoming with me if I am not meeting expectations in anyway. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on my knowledge of Bootcamp, I will seek help in a timely manner by first investigating a solution myself. If I am stuck for more than half an hour I will reach out to my peers. If they are unable to help me I will engage with the Bootcamp team. I will try to be timely so that I don’t waste time being proud.
        </p>

        <p>
          To manage my workload I will ensure, by checking with my peers and Bootcamp team, that my Timebox chunks are realistic. I will make sure that I have a good understanding of what I need to do before I begin to do it. I will use my Pomodoro timer when I need to to ensure I am maximising my productivity. I will be polite and helpful in reciprocation.
        </p>

        <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3>25 April 2019</h3>

        <p>
          I ultimately want to be a Project Manager or Product Lead within the IT industry. I love managing and growing people within a team. My preferences: I would love to operate within an area of IT that deals with VR, AR, machine learning or even game development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to improve my time-management and productivity skills more than anything. The past few years of my work life has seen little improvement of these skills so I would like to make up the slight lag I may have acquired when compared to my peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also like to develop my ability to take other people’s input onboard more effectively. I am painfully stubborn and don’t always respond to criticism or suggestion very well.
        </p>
        <p>
          My strengths include anything that requires innate abilities with human interaction. I’m a competent, agile human being when it comes to interpersonal dynamics. I read people well and relate to people on an individual level with ease. I am patient with people and an effective teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have well developed visual-spatial skills, problem solving and ‘bigger picture’ abilities. As a consequence I can find the minutiae of projects frustrating, preferring to guide a broader process rather than partake in the individual parts. This is something I’m really hoping Software Development will help me to develop into a strength. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as limitations go - I can procrastinate better than most if I’m not enthused by a task. I don’t work well without a clear purpose and I’m susceptible to distractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When having an argument or difference of opinion I can be frustratingly direct and logical. I struggle to bring my emotions into arguments which doesn’t help mitigate disagreements. I would like to work on being less dispassionate. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing I really want to stick to is being procedural in how I tackle tasks. I want to be methodical from the outset. I want to define my goals before I try to tackle them and break them into manageable chunks to avoid becoming overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan to use pomodoro for high-focus tasks like programming and want to develop this into a second-nature habit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to stay engaged with tasks I want to work with a team of mixed strengths. This way, we can all hopefully tackle the task that is best suited to each individuals strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will look for answers to problems by myself first. I will use the resources available to me before reaching out to my peers. If I still can’t find resolution from these two resources I will reach out to my facilitator. I will try to avoid being too proud, wasting time when help is only a question away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like the facilitation team to make sure that I am sticking to my promises of focus and application. If I feel like I am meeting expectations I am more likely to work harder to achieve my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I won’t do work or check messages when I am with my family. I feel strongly about having as few interruptions as possible when I’m having quality time. I plan to be selectively productive so that my work doesn’t bleed into my private life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have kindergarten drop offs for my 3-year old 3 days a week. I will aim to be on site as soon as I have dropped him off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am lucky that my partner’s work can be flexible during my time at EDA. As such, I shouldn’t have too much difficulty giving it everything I have.
